# Ray Tracing Visualization

## Instructions ##

The Bundles folder should contain any JSON scene definitions that you would like to work with. 

The OBJ folder should contain any OBJ files that you would like to work with.

Open main.html. Upon loading, a GUI will display a "Load File" option. Click the button and select either a JSON file from ./Bundles or an OBJ file from ./OBJ

Note: You can load multiple scenes/files of both JSON and OBJ format by clicking the "Load File" option again. The previous load will not be affected unless the page is refreshed.
