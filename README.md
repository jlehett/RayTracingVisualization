# Ray Tracing Visualization

## Instructions ##

The Bundles folder should contain any JSON scene definition that you would like to work with. 

Open fileSelector.html, click the "Browse" button, and select the JSON file you would like to work with within the Bundles directory.
Upon selecting, you will be redirected to the visualization html page.

If you would like to skip uploading a file, place a file with filename "raybundle.json" in the Bundles directory and open the main.html.
